2.	How do sales and profit performances vary across different segments, categories, and sub-categories within each region?
3.	Can a distinct upward or downward trend in sales performance be identified over time?
4.	What are the correlations between key metrics (e.g., sales, profit, discount, and quantity)?
5.	What are the key drivers of sales performance and profitability?
6.	What sales trends can be projected for the next 36 months?
7.	Who are the top customers and products driving 80% of total sales?
8.	 Can we identify customer clusters and their behaviors?
9.	 What sales patterns emerge through market basket analysis?

 ## **üìà The Analysis**
Each piece of code in this project was designed for a comprehensive analysis by leveraging sales data from 2020 to 2023 to identify patterns, uncover trends, explore customer behaviour, and reveal the factors driving sales and profitability. The goal is to optimize business strategies, resource allocation, and decisions related to products, inventory, and pricing. By enabling data-driven decision-making, the analysis aims to maximize sales, increase profitability, improve customer satisfaction, enhance operational efficiency, and uncover investment opportunities for long-term success. Here‚Äôs how I approached each task/question:

### **1. Yearly Breakdown of Sales, Quantities, Profits, and Percentage Growth**

**Task / Question**: Were there any years that experienced negative or stagnant growth? Moreover, are there significant differences within the data?

**Purpose**: To identify trends over time and detect periods of underperformance or stagnation, as well as to assess whether variations in key metrics (e.g., revenue, profit, Volume ) are statistically or practically significant. This helps pinpoint problem areas that  may require further investigation or corrective action.

![7a  Key Sales Performance Drivers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ca6f515-ab99-4beb-8d14-db0de5f96315)

![7b  Key Drivers of Profitability](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/228f088f-b17c-4f64-8f1a-990becb46219)

### **Insights from Feature Importance and Regression Analysis**:
**Sales Performance Drivers**: Profit, specific subcategories (such as Copiers, Machines, and Tables), and Quantity are the main drivers of Sales. While Discount also has a positive effect on Sales, it‚Äôs important to be cautious, as excessive discounts could negatively impact profitability.

**Profit Performance Drivers**: Sales, Discount, and key subcategories like Binders, Bookcases, Chairs, and Copiers drive Profit. While Discounts positively impact Profit, excessive discounting could reduce profitability. Quantity negatively affects Profit, suggesting that higher sales volumes may come with lower margins or increased costs, like production or shipping.
