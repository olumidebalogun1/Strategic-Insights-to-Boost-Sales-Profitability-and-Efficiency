#####  9.  Identifying Top Customers Driving 80% of Total Sales  #####

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  TASK/QUESTION: Which customers account for 80% of the businessâ€™s total sales?

#  PURPOSE: To identify the key customers who contribute significantly (80%)
#           to total sales. By prioritizing these high-value customers, 
#           businesses can optimize engagement strategies, allocate marketing
#           resources efficiently, and implement retention plans to foster growth,
#           maximize revenue, and build long-term success.

# ------  Grouping by Customer Name and Calculating Total Sales ------
# This block aggregates total sales for each customer and calculates  
# additional metrics such as sales contribution percentage, and cumulative percentage.
