#####  10.  Identifying Top Products Driving 80% of Total Sales  #####

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  TASK/QUESTION: Which products contribute to 80% of the businessâ€™s total sales?

#  PURPOSE: To  that contribute 80% of total sales. By focusing on these high-value
#           products, businesses can optimize engagement strategies, allocate
#           marketing resources more effectively, and develop retention plans 
#           that drive growth, maximize revenue, and support long-term success.

# ------  Grouping by Product Name and Calculating Total Sales ------
# This block aggregates total sales for each product and calculates  
# additional metrics such as sales contribution percentage, and cumulative percentage.
